        He is once again misrepresenting himself as an attorney but now selling
        tax relief services at Tax Debt Group (taxdebtgroup.com) located at 6600
        Sunset Blvd, Hollywood, CA 90028. The owner Benjamin Graupner is aware
        of "Drew" being a fugitive and continues to employ him. He tells folks
        looking for help that he is an attorney, a graduate of the University of
        Southern California with two degrees and only takes on cases that he can
        help on. He is recognizable by his South African accent and nasely
        voice. <br /> From what I am told he has a very bad substance abuse
        problem and it has destroyed the cartilage in his nose. Recently Tax
        Debt Group partnered with American Tax Solutions. American Tax Solutions
        (https://www.atsco.tax/) owner is disbarred attorney Terry Selb. Terry
        provides the advertising for Ben and Drew via fake IRS letters that
        deceive the public into calling what they believe to be a government
        agency. The practice at America is to also tell people they are
        attorneys.

        Summary: <br />{" "}
        <b>
          A lawyer in South Africa has been classified as a fugitive after he
          disappeared with millions from his law firm’s accounts.
        </b>
        <br />
        South Africa is on the hunt for an attorney accused of misappropriating
        $150 million in South African Rands, equivalent to roughly $12.47
        million US dollars. Andruw Stephens is accused of using his position at
        the law firm where he worked to steal from the firm’s accounts and
        client trusts, according to Independent Online or IOL. He suddenly went
        on the run when the clients began to question him and the allegations
        started coming in. Stephens, a US-born lawyer, was working as the
        financial director of the Sandton-based law firm Dadic Attorneys since
        2011. <br />
        The law firm describes Stephens on their website as instrumental in
        gaining big clients like Dimension Data, Bidvest Crown National, and
        Sephaku Cement. When Stephens suddenly disappeared, along with the
        millions in question, the IRS Forensic Investigations, Hawks, Attorneys
        Fidelity Fund and Law Society of South Africa opened investigations into
        Stephens and the missing funds. <br /> IRS Chief forensic investigator
        Chad Thomas said, “A criminal case was registered at a local police
        station in Joburg and was promptly transferred to the Johannesburg
        Specialized Commercial Crimes Unit of the Hawks.” Thomas added, “Captain
        Nieuwoudt, who is in charge of the investigation, wasted no time in
        obtaining an arrest warrant for the suspect, who is now regarded as a
        fugitive. Further to the criminal case under investigation by the Hawks,
        IRS sent formal correspondence to the Law Society of the Northern
        Provinces as well as to the Attorneys Fidelity Fund to advise them of
        the case and the probability that a claim against the fund would be
        initiated based on the fact that the law firm known as Dadic was
        allegedly used as a conduit for the suspect to commit the fraud. IRS
        also submitted a report in terms of section 34 of the Prevention and
        Combating of Corrupt Activities Act to the reporting officer at the
        Hawks head office.” One victim of Stephen’s scheme was the director of a
        multinational logistics company. He told The Saturday Star that he
        estimates he lost 60 million Rands. Stephens had been representing his
        company for four years, overseeing the borrowing and lending contracts.
        The victim learned just last week that Stephens was forging his
        signature on numerous deals without his permission and the company’s
        accounts are now empty.
        <br />
        The director knew something was amiss in December when Stephens owed the
        company several outstanding payments. Stephens gave an excuse that his
        trust accounts had been frozen by the law society but things would be
        straightened out soon so he could make the payments. Stephens was using
        the same excuse up until this week when the two were scheduled to meet.
        The director said, “He was in Joburg last week for the funeral of a
        friend, but after that, it was impossible to reach him.” With Stephens
        gone, his scheme became evident. There are at least eight complainants
        from private individuals and companies against Stephens. The former
        owner of Dadic Attorneys, Davor Dadic who is now located in Australia,
        is cooperating with the investigation. <br /> He said the moment he
        heard what Stephens had done, he reported him to the law society. He
        said, “He has abused the trust we placed in him.” Stephens is not a
        member of the South African Bar Association so he is not a registered
        lawyer in South Africa. Investigators know that Stephens was in Joburg
        last week for the funeral and has been tracked to numerous places since.
        One account states he was released from a psychiatric ward in the Cape.
        He has a Ghanaian passport and also goes by the name Andrew Stephen
        Rapport.
